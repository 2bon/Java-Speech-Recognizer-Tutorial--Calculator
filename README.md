# Java-Speech-Recognizer-Tutorial--Calculator

Follow this awesome tutorials to learn how to implement a speech recognizer in Java step by step using Sphinx4.

In Tutorial 2 we implement a calculator witch recognizes what you are saying for example (2+2) and it prints a result.

In Tutorial 3 the calculator get's more advanced and is recognizing numbers from 1 to 20,instead of only printing the result it is also saying it loud.I am talking about text to speech library used which is MaryTTS.
